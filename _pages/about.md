Welcome to my little slice of the world wide web. 

I staked a claim to this parcel of webspace and my wonderful [Montenegrin URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.me) all the way back in September 2018 as a means of hosting some projects. To that end, you can find a collection of my [projects here](projects/) and my professional [resume here](resume/).

A bit more about me:

+ I currently live in beautiful Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
+ I was born in beautiful Trivandrum, Kerala, India.
+ I'm an avid fan of the Calgary Flames.
+ I'm not a fan of bananas.
+ I love a good heist movie.
+ I also love a bad heist movie.


Thanks for stopping by!
