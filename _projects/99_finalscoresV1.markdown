It was the summer of 2018, I had just learned how to efficiently wrangle a vast amount of data from the [NHL's statistics portal](http://www.nhl.com/stats/) (see this blog post for more details). In an effort to apply some newly learned Python skills, I started several projects related to NHL stats. This was the first of these projects to reach anything resembling a finished product.

I set out to answer the question **What are the most common final scores in NHL history?** However, that wouldn't make for much of a very interesting visualization. So, I eventually chose to plot the distribution of final scores split by home vs. away.
